    'Helen Slaughterhouse was thinking about Roger Smart again. Roger was a popular rover with skinny fingers and chubby ankles.Helen walked over to the window and reflected on her old-fashioned surroundings. She had always loved cosy Athens with its unkempt, united umbrellas. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel barmy.Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a popular figure of Roger Smart.Helen gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a sinister, tight-fisted, tea drinker with spiky fingers and wide ankles. Her friends saw her as a breakable, brawny brute. Once, she had even helped a purring old lady cross the road.But not even a sinister person who had once helped a purring old lady cross the road, was prepared for what Roger had in store today.The rain hammered like chatting monkeys, making Helen ecstatic. Helen grabbed a tattered newspaper that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.As Helen stepped outside and Roger came closer, she could see the excited glint in his eye."Look Helen,"growled Roger, with an intelligent glare that reminded Helen of popular toads. "It\'s not that I don\'t love you, but I want equality. You owe me 2707 gold pieces."Helen looked back, even more ecstatic and still fingering the tattered newspaper. "Roger, get out of my house,"she replied.They looked at each other with concerned feelings, like two rich, racid rabbits drinking at a very generous birthday party, which had jazz music playing in the background and two scheming uncles smiling to the beat.Helen regarded Roger\'s skinny fingers and chubby ankles. "I don\'t have the funds ..." she lied.Roger glared. "Do you want me to shove that tattered newspaper where the sun don\'t shine?"Helen promptly remembered her sinister and tight-fisted values. "Actually, I do have the funds," she admitted. She reached into her pockets. "Here\'s what I owe you."Roger looked sleepy, his wallet blushing like a knowing, knobby kettle.Then Roger came inside for a nice cup of tea.THE END ';
